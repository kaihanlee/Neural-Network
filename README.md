# neural-network

Main function is in the sentiment classifier.py file

* **reader** contains dataset loader
* **model** contains perceptron and gradient descent function
* **data** contains raw data and GridSearchCV output

Feature Engineering which includes GridSearch Cross Validation, CountVectorizer, TfIdfTransformer from scikit.learn open source library

Hyperparameter Tuning on Perceptron and Gradient Descent

Note that Gradient Descent uses Squared Loss and L2-norm regulariser.
